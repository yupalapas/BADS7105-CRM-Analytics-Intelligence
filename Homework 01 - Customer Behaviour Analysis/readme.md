**Customer Behaviour Analysis**
-------------------------------------------------
A customer behavior analysis provides insight into the different variables that influence an audience. It gives you an idea of the motives, priorities, and decision-making methods being considered during the customer's journey. This analysis helps you understand how customers feel about of your company, as well as if that perception aligns with their core values.
