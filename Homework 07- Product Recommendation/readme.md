**Product Recommendation using items-items based collaborative filtering**
--------------------------------------------
Collaborative filtering is a correlation rule-based algorithm. The following example shows how collaborative filtering predicts the interests of customers A and B in products a, b, and c. If both customers A and B have purchased products X and Y, collaborative filtering determines that customers A and B have similar interests in shopping. Collaborative filtering then recommends product Z to customer B because customer A has purchased product Z. This is a classic example of using features of users as a correlation.
